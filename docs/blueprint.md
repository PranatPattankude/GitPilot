## Core Features:

- GitHub Authentication: Enable login via GitHub OAuth2.
- Repository Listing: List all repositories for a logged-in user or organization.
- Branch Comparison and Diffing: Compare branches across selected repos and display file diffs using an editor.
- Bulk Branch Merging: Merge a feature branch into the main branch across multiple repositories, including conflict resolution editor.
- Release Tracking: Create a release record in Firestore after each merge with repo name, branch, commit SHA, timestamp, and user.
- Build Status Monitoring: Monitor linked GitHub Actions and build statuses (success, running, failed).
- Intelligent Conflict Resolution: When the user chooses a suggestion for conflict resolution in the merge UI, use a tool to determine if additional, unseen lines from the file are likely to match, and then apply them too.

- Use modern, flat icons from a set like Remix Icon or Font Awesome to represent repositories, branches, and build statuses.
- Dashboard layout with tabs for repositories, merge, release history, and build status.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading states and status updates.
